        <p className="text-slate-300 max-w-3xl">
          Compete in daily quizzes, earn coins, and track your progress on live leaderboards. Quiz
          Dangal is built for India with opinion-based and GK rounds that are fun and fair. If you
          love short, exciting contests you can play between classes or on your daily commute, this
          guide explains how Play & Win works and how to improve your scores.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">How Play & Win Works</h2>
        <p className="text-slate-300 max-w-3xl">
          Each contest has a small set of questions and a clear timer. Answer as accurately and as
          quickly as possible to collect coins. You can join public rounds throughout the day, see
          your ranking on leaderboards, and rejoin future rounds to beat your best. Opinion-based
          rounds keep the pressure low, while GK rounds test your recall and speed.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Scoring & Fair Play</h2>
        <p className="text-slate-300 max-w-3xl">
          Scores are calculated transparently. For knowledge quizzes, correct answers give more
          weight than response time, so accuracy matters. We use anti-cheat checks and server-side
          verification to ensure fair play. Your total coins reflect your consistent performance
          across multiple contests, not a single lucky streak.
        </p>
